Fractional Brownian Motion crate for Rust. An attempt to keep parity with the Python fpm module: https://github.com/crflynn/fbm
Code is largely directly taken from that Python module and twisted until it compiles.

Currently untested, it's quite possible I've made serious mistakes. Pull requests welcome.
